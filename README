# LRToolkit

LRToolkit is a collection of categories and useful classes that I use across my various iPhone and iPad projects; stuff thats too small to have a repository of its own or has previously only been available in Gist form.

All code is available under the MIT license unless otherwise specified; where code has come from an external source, I have tried to credit the original author and if the license for the code differs, it will be included in the head of the source.

An overview of some of the key classes will follow.
